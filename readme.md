## Kits (libraries) for Cozy Engine.

**Cozy is not currently released.** If you've somehow gotten access to this repository, hopefully I've actually given it to you and you know what's up. When/if I do ever release it, it will be under a permissive license (probably something like MIT).

In preparation for release, this repository will get cleaned up, and a better description added, or it will be merged into the Cozy repository -- https://bitbucket.org/speveril/cozy/src/master/
